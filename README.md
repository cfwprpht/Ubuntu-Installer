Ubuntu Installer
=================================

## Whats that ?
This is a Open Source Ubuntu 16.04 Installer. With some tiny tweaks it should work on all Linux distros.
This one is especially written for Ubuntu.
- Replace dummy_app.zip with your one.
- Do the same with the icon of your app and the Software.png (This will also be used for installation)
- Add the informations into the Gui.
- Adjust the .dekstop and .uninstall.desktop entrys to match your app.
- Adjust the uninstall script.

From there you're ready to compille a Standalone Installer for your Application.

If your app needs super user rights you can comment in, the parts, for the SU Password.
